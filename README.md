# Hotword Training Server

This repository contains the source code to a hotword training server.
The server exposes a REST API to train Snowboy hotword detection models
via uploaded WAV audio files. Requires Python 3.6+.

## Setup and usage

First, clone the repository and change to it:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mideind/HotwordTrainingServer
$ cd HotwordTrainingServer
```

Create and activate virtual environment, install dependencies:

```
$ virtualenv -p /path/to/python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install Snowboy for model generation:

```
$ bash setup.sh
```

You should now be able to run the web application via `uvicorn`:

```
$ uvicorn main:app
```

The main API endpoint is `/train`. See autogenerated docs at `/docs`. To test
via web form upload, visit `/test`.
